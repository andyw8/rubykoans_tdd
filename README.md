This project shows some examples of TDD practice against the Rubykoans examples.

I'm using the strict workflow of Red / Green / Refactor.

I've made a commit at each point when the tests are green, and also after I refactor them.

Browsing through the commit history shows how I 'triangulated' on the solution.
